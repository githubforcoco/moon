    detail: "Djokovic, seeded 12th, won 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7-3) to claim a 13th Slam - his first major since the 2016 French Open.\n\nThe Serb, 31, quickly took control to win the opening set in 29 minutes, breaking twice more in the second set.\n\nDjokovic saw off five set points in an even third set before dominating the tie-break to seal victory.\n\nHe dropped to his haunches just inside the baseline as Centre Court rose to acclaim the champion, hugging South African Anderson at the net before skipping over towards his box and celebrating wildly in front of his coaching team and wife Jelena.\n\n“I had many moments of doubt, I didn't know if could come back to this level to compete,” said Djokovic, who also won the Wimbledon title in 2011, 2014 and 2015.\n\n“There is no better place to make a comeback, it's a sacred place for the world of tennis, it's very special.”\n\nHe is now in outright fourth place on the all-time list of Grand Slam men's singles titles, moving clear of Roy Emerson and closing the gap on Roger Federer (20), Rafael Nadal (17) and Pete Sampras (14).\n\nThe former world number one will move back into the top 10 when the latest rankings are released on Monday.\n\nIt is his first title since winning Eastbourne last year.",
