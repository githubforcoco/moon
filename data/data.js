  author: "BBC News",
  detail: "Mr Trump said the letter from Mr Kim (dated 6 July), was “a very nice note”. \n\n But it made no mention of any efforts by Pyongyang towards denuclearisation - a key issue the two leaders discussed at June's historic summit in Singapore. \n\nSeparately, the US has accused North Korea of violating a UN sanctions cap on refined oil products. \n\n It said this had been done through ship- to - ship transfers at sea using 89 North Korean tankers.The US did not say which countries were illicitly providing Pyongyang with the products. \n\n In December, the UN Security Council limited such exports to North Korea to 500, 000 barrels a year. \n\n North Korea: New UN sanctions 'an act of war' \n\n Trump-Kim summit: What did it actually achieve? \n\n In another development on Thursday, North Korean officials failed to turn up for talks with a US team on the repatriation of the remains of American soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean war.",

The car has been tested in Canada, where the country’s aviation authority has authorised its use.\n\nLike Kitty Hawk, BlackFly could perhaps be more accurately described as a human- carrying drone. It is not designed to be driven on roads.\nThe vehicle carries one person in a small cockpit, powered by “eight propulsion systems, spread across two wings”.\n\n    It works best, Opener says, when taking off and landing from grassy surfaces.\n\n'Total command'\n\n“Watching BlackFly take flight just blew me away, ” said Darren Pleasance, director of the US Experimental Aircraft Association.“I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n\nWhile the vehicle will not require a pilot's licence, Opener said as a precaution riders would have to undergo a training programme in order to become acquainted.",

  detail: "“It began after I went on a girls' weekend away,” she says.\n\n“We had gone on an adventure activity called a tree-top walk.\n\n”I managed to climb up to do it - but then when it came to stepping out on to the high ropes, I just couldn't do it.\n\n“I felt physically ill and panicked, even though I knew I was perfectly safe.”\n\nHer phobia got worse over the next few years, to the point that it stopped her doing everyday things.\n\n“I went to a concert at Wembley to see Take That,” she says.\n\n“It's a massive venue and our seats were at the back, high up.\n\n”I tried to go up there to take my seat - but all of a sudden I had this feeling of utter panic.\n\n“It was a bit like in the cartoons when the character's eyeballs go out on strings.”\n\nAcrophobia\n\nFay, now 48, started avoiding fearful situations, which, for her, included riding escalators.\n\n“It was the downward ones that worried me the most,” she says.\n\n“It wasn't so much that I was worried about tripping, I was scared of being up high and the sensation of getting pulled downwards.”\n\nThen, Fay, who works in malaria research at Oxford University, heard about a phobia therapy trial taking place in a different part of the institution.\n\nShe applied and was invited to join in. But, unfortunately, she was placed in the control group rather than the treatment one that would try out the new innovation - a virtual reality (VR) program for acrophobia (the medical term for a fear of heights).",

  content: "In a timeline of risky rhythm, Arwa Haider looks at how desperate times have called for defiant moves.",
  author: "BBC News",
  detail: "At first glance, the Instagram videos posted by 18-year-old Maedeh Hojabri look fairly innocuous; they show the Iranian teen dancing in her room to Persian and Western pop tunes. Yet these upbeat clips have provoked serious controversy; Hojabri was recently arrested for breaching Iranian government laws which prohibit females from dancing in public or appearing without a headscarf. Last Friday, she appeared on Iranian state TV, making an apparent confession (“It was not done for the purpose of attracting attention,” she said, adding: “I did not have any intention to encourage others”).\n\nHojabri’s treatment has been widely condemned by the public and even religious commentators (Iranian cleric Mohamad Taghi Fazel Maybodi argued: “Which one’s a great sin – dancing or stealing of public resources?”).Most notably, she has inspired massive online solidarity, including hundreds of Iranian women posting videos of themselves dancing, in support of the teen. Tehran - based photographer Reihane Taravati, who was herself arrested with friends in 2014, for dancing on screen to a Pharrell Williams smash hit, tweeted: “You arrested me for being #Happy when I was 23. Now you arrest #MaedehHojabri and she is only 18! What will you do to the next generation?”\n\nThe notion that dancing is dangerous and subversive is actually deep-rooted and wide-ranging. Throughout history, international dances have inflamed passions and come under Puritanical fire. Back in the 17th Century, British writer and lawyer William Prynne condemned dancing as “a liberty to wantonnesse, a friend to wickednesse, and a provocation to fleshly lust… a pastime unworthy of all honest persons”.\n\nPopular dance crazes have sparked moral hysteria, being raged about in pamphlets such as From The Ballroom To Hell(1894) and The Heritage Of Hell(1942); in the latter, US author Dan Gilbert gets frothed up about the jitterbug (“Conceived in hell and brought forth by the brothel, the dance has established its immoral dominion”). Whatever the era, region or rhythm, the base ‘danger’ remains the same – that dancing promotes sexual liberty and/or breaks down social barriers. And so, around the world, dance has always been a vital act of rebellion.",

  detail: "Rio Ferdinand had his own record label, Gary Neville has appeared onstage with The Charlatans, Daniel Sturridge likes to rap battle, and Leighton Baines is close friends with mod mucker Miles Kane.\n\nSo what are the England team currently putting on their headphones? Let's find out. But, first of all, a message from Drizzy:\n\nDrake BBC Sport tweet\n\n1. Harry Kane\n\nTwitter: Calvin Harris tweet\n\nVery much the hero of the hour, Harry Kane likes to psych himself up before matches with a righteous blast of The Prodigy's Firestarter. In a recent promotional film, he said: “It's a great motivational song. For me, Firestarter means it's time to be ready. As soon as I hear it I know it's game time. It's time to get in the zone - and be ready to give the best performance.”\n\n2. Jesse Lingard\n\nTwitter: Jesse Lingard goal celebrations\n\nAs we can see from this clip, Jessie's goal celebrations reveal a deep love of dance moves, so it's no surprise he's a beat disciple, being a particular fan of Drake. When asked if he prefers UK grime to US hip hop, he plumped for the former, saying, “I listen to both, but more grime before matches to get you kind of pumped up. But then I might switch to the US hip hop to just vibe out.”\n\nAnd in the same interview, asked to name a song he can recite from start to finish, he chose Drake's Dreams Money Can Buy: “That was one of the first songs I fell in love with when I was younger. I listened to it from, like, when I was 14.”\n\n3. Kieran Trippier\n\nTwitter - Kieran Trippier\n\nYou might expect a player with a surname like Kieran's to favour psychedelia or ambient house music, but his music tastes are fairly straightforward pop. He likes Jess Glynne - particularly Right Here - and Ed Sheeran's Runaway, and he was a particular fan of the beatific dance groove of Benediction by Hot Natured featuring Ali Love.",

  content: "Autumn is a very special time of year as the temperature cools and the days get shorter. Here’s a preview of what the natural world has to offer this season",
  author: "BBC News",
  detail: "We all love autumn don’t we? It’s that special time of year when the weather begins to get discernibly cooler and the nights noticeably longer.\n\nAutumn heralds the transition into the cold, dark and desolate winter months, and the natural world puts on a final flurry of amazing activity before slowing down until the warmer sunshine of spring returns.\n\nAnd the UK is no exception, boasting some world-class wildlife spectacles.\n\nSo if you're not too hot on autumn, here are ten fantastic reasons why you should be.\n\nFungal forays\n\nAfter the warmth of summer and dampness of autumn there is an explosion of mushrooms and toadstools happening right across the country, from woodland floors to decaying logs and meadows. What we see on our fungal forays are the fruiting bodies preparing to release their spores that give rise to the next generation of ecological recyclers.\n\nFungi are quite different to both plants and animals and have their own kingdom.Here in the UK there could be as many as 15, 000 species, with a great diversity in size, colour and shape. However, many of these are extremely poisonous and should only be identified with a reliable guide, or better still, an expert guided walk which will help you get the most from this seasonal highlight. Find a fungal foray with the Wildlife Trusts.\n\nMisty mornings\n\nOne of the perks of the cooling temperatures, longer nights and increased moisture in the air is a walk in the countryside on a misty autumnal morning. The UK has some stunning fields, parks and open spaces just ripe for an early morning excursion. So there’s no excuse for not heading out before the sun has had time to burn off all the lovely mist! Visit one of the UK’s 15 National Parks early one morning – your early rise will be worth it.\n\nDazzling displays\n\nThe pulsating clouds of hundreds of thousands of starlings all swirling and turning in jaw-dropping unison can only be described as an ‘awesome wildlife spectacle’. These murmurations happen during autumn and winter over fields, woodlands and reedbeds as they seek out their communal roosting site for the night and so are best viewed just before dusk.\n\nWhy do they put on this magnificent display? It’s certainly not just for our delight; it’s thought that starlings gather together for protection from predators, as it is harder to pick out individuals from within an amorphous, hypnotising cloud.They may also congregate to keep warm at night and pass information about good feeding sites. There are great places for spectacular views throughout the country, including Brighton Pier of all places.Find out where to experience a starling murmuration near you with the RSPB.\n\n    Nature’s bounty\n\nAutumn could be described as the time of plenty with fruits, nuts and seeds everywhere. There is a dazzling array of colours, shapes and methods that plants employ for spreading the next generation for the following year. These delights are gratefully harvested by many species looking to build up their fat reserves for migration or hibernation – and they’re also popular with us!\n\nBut don’t worry as there’s usually enough to go round.Many animals and birds love fruits such as blackberries, rose-hips, sloes, crab apples, elderberries and haws, while acorns are a firm favourite of jays and squirrels, which they store, or 'cache', for the winter. Don’t forget the school yard classic, the conker.The rich brown coloured seed of the horse chestnut tree provides hours of childhood fun.Discover the top nuts, seeds and berries to forage for in September from the BBC Countryfile magazine.\n\nFight clubs\n\nLike the weather, this time of year can also be quite violent because it’s the deer rutting season. Rival males fight each other with wicked-looking antlers in order to attract a harem of females. The top stag then gets to mate with as many of them as possible. The most impressive antlers belong to either the large red deer or the slightly smaller fallow.\n\nWoodlands, parks and country estates are good places to catch a glimpse of these majestic battles. But with the stakes so high there can be some very serious injuries among the combatants, so when observing keep a safe distance. The best times are at dawn and dusk, so listen out for those bellows and grunts before the contest begins. Find out more about the British deer rut from the BBC Wildlife magazine.\n\nSeas of change\n\nThere is no doubt that the reds, golden-yellows and browns in British woodland at this time of year are simply stunning and one of the highlights of the season. Simply put the shorter days and cooler temperatures trigger the leaves' green photosynthetic pigment (called chlorophyll) to break down, allowing other yellow and orange pigments to show through, before the leaves are finally lost in preparation for winter.\n\nYou’ll find these beautiful colours in most UK woodlands that have deciduous trees such as chestnut, oak and beech. Follow autumn’s blaze of colour across the country with the Forestry Commission.\n\nWelcome returns\n\nWe are familiar with birds such as swallows, swifts and cuckoos leaving the country in autumn for warmer climates and escape our winter. As these are departing, however, tens of millions of birds are arriving from places such as Scandinavia, the Arctic and northern Europe, where winters are far harsher than ours. The UK offers milder weather for them and food is easier to find.\n\nOur overwintering birds include colourful thrushes such as fieldfares and redwings, swans, many kinds of duck, geese and wading birds, and water birds that spend winter on the sea around the UK coast. Look out for mass congregations on fields and estuaries, which are our most nutritious habitats.Find out why Britain is a wildlife migration hotspot with BBC iWonder.\n\nBeauty all around\n\nTake a look round any meadow, hedgerow, garden or car on a cold autumn morning and be rewarded by the sight of delicate spiders’ webs outlined in dew. This time of year really highlights just how many spiders we have; with favourable breeding conditions that number could be in excess of 750 million from approximately 600 different species. Here are some of the many reasons why we should all love spiders from BBC iWonder.\n\nFlower power\n\nAutumn is not a time usually associated with flowering plants, but for ivy it is its time to bloom! The clusters of inconspicuous yellow-green flowers are a valuable source of nectar for bees and butterflies before they hibernate. While the black berries in winter and spring are important food sources for birds when most other fruits have disappeared.\n\nBecause ivy is such an important food source for wildlife, recording the timing of flowering and fruiting need to be monitored to help assess the effects of any changes in climate.Find out more about ivy recording and how you can take part with Nature’s Calendar.\n\nPuppy love\n\nSome of the most extraordinary sights and sounds of autumn come from a grey seal colony because this is when thousands come ashore to give birth to pups. Baby seals can be incredibly cute and very noisy when calling for mum, but please observe them from a safe distance so as not to disturb them. The bond between mother and baby is very fragile and the pup is dependent on its mother’s milk to survive.\n\nOnce pups have been weaned it’s time to mate again and leads to another of nature’s great spectacles: bull seals fighting.Males take part in vicious and bloody fights for territory and access to harems of females.Find out more about where to watch marine wildlife.\n\nRecording seasonal signs with Nature’s Calendar can help scientists assess the impact of climate change on our wildlife and track how the seasons are developing across the country.",
