Blend to a fine paste before adding to the pan, along with the peas. Cook for a further five minutes, stirring thoroughly.Tear the curry leaves into the pan and stir in the yoghurt.\n\nTo serve, take the pan off the heat and pour the coconut oil over the vegetables, if using.Spoon the mixture on to six serving plates and serve with basmati rice.",
