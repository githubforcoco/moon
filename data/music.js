    detail: "Rio Ferdinand had his own record label, Gary Neville has appeared onstage with The Charlatans, Daniel Sturridge likes to rap battle, and Leighton Baines is close friends with mod mucker Miles Kane.\n\nSo what are the England team currently putting on their headphones? Let's find out. But, first of all, a message from Drizzy:\n\nDrake BBC Sport tweet\n\n1. Harry Kane\n\nTwitter: Calvin Harris tweet\n\nVery much the hero of the hour, Harry Kane likes to psych himself up before matches with a righteous blast of The Prodigy's Firestarter. In a recent promotional film, he said: “It's a great motivational song. For me, Firestarter means it's time to be ready. As soon as I hear it I know it's game time. It's time to get in the zone - and be ready to give the best performance.”\n\n2. Jesse Lingard\n\nTwitter: Jesse Lingard goal celebrations\n\nAs we can see from this clip, Jessie's goal celebrations reveal a deep love of dance moves, so it's no surprise he's a beat disciple, being a particular fan of Drake. When asked if he prefers UK grime to US hip hop, he plumped for the former, saying, “I listen to both, but more grime before matches to get you kind of pumped up. But then I might switch to the US hip hop to just vibe out.”\n\nAnd in the same interview, asked to name a song he can recite from start to finish, he chose Drake's Dreams Money Can Buy: “That was one of the first songs I fell in love with when I was younger. I listened to it from, like, when I was 14.”\n\n3. Kieran Trippier\n\nTwitter - Kieran Trippier\n\nYou might expect a player with a surname like Kieran's to favour psychedelia or ambient house music, but his music tastes are fairly straightforward pop. He likes Jess Glynne - particularly Right Here - and Ed Sheeran's Runaway, and he was a particular fan of the beatific dance groove of Benediction by Hot Natured featuring Ali Love.",
